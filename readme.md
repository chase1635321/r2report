# r2report

A radare2 plugin to generate malware reports from projects.

## Ideas
- Syntax highlighting in code blocks
- Add function call graphs of important functions
- Nicely formatted header for OS, bits, filesize, hashes, function count, etc
- Add icons
- Panels like these: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/components/panels/
- Color highlight certain things
- Visual circle/pie graphs with relative section sizes and function sizes

## Command structure
- Re: Report edit
- Ro: Report output (can output to html, or reduced pdf version)
- Rp: Print the report
